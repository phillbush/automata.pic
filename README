                              automata.pic

This is a set of macros for the pic language designed to draw finite
state machines (aka automata).  I'm writing these macros during my
classes of Theory of Computation at the University of Bras√≠lia in order
to take notes and write exercises.  I may add more stuff as I learn more
about automata.

There is a pdf file with an example.

To use it, include the file automata.pic between the first .PS .PE block:
{
	.PS
	copy "circuit.pic"
	.PE
}
